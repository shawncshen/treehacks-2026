# MindOS — TreeHacks 2026

## We were selected as part of TreeHacks 2026, one of the world’s largest student hackathons, where 1,000 hackers were chosen from 15,000+ applicants to build ambitious technology projects.

### Our Idea

MindOS is a silent speech interface that turns micro muscle signals (EMG) from the jaw and throat into real computer actions.
It enables users to communicate and control software without speaking or using their hands.

What it does:
- Silent intent → action: users silently mouth commands detected via EMG
- Hands-free control: browse, search, and navigate without a keyboard or voice
- Adaptive learning: users can append new training data to personalize decoding
   Assistive-first design: built for people who cannot rely on speech or motor input

Why we built it

Millions of people with ALS, stroke recovery, or severe mobility impairments have clear thoughts but limited ways to express them digitally.
We wanted to build a non-invasive, practical interface that works in situations where voice and typing fail.

Thank you TreeHacks!
